As per Wikipedia -  The "Eisenhower Method"[11] or "Eisenhower Principle" is a method that utilizes the principles
of importance and urgency to organize priorities and workload. This method stems from a quote attributed to Dwight D. Eisenhower:
"I have two kinds of problems, the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never
urgent." Eisenhower did not claim this insight for his own, but attributed it to an (unnamed) "former college president.".
